Create a C# program with a class called DebitCard with a property called "Pin" with validations in the 
set accessor.

The Pin should be exactly 4 digits or 6 digits.

If the supplied pin is invalid, it shows error message.



Examples:

Pin = "1234"     -->  valid

Pin = "1234ef"     -->  invalid

Pin = "123456"     -->  valid

Pin = "0"     -->  invalid

Pin = "a4"     -->  invalid
